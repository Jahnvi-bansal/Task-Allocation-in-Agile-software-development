# Task Allocation in Agile Software Development
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to allocate tasks efficiently within an Agile framework using data analysis and machine learning. It leverages employee skill data to match team members with suitable tasks, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

## Features
1. Data preprocessing and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.
2. Machine learning for predictive task assignment using:  
  a. Random Forest  
  b. Gradient Boosting  
 c. Logistic Regression  
 d. Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  e. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
3. Performance evaluation through accuracy scores and classification reports.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset named employee_skills_dataset.xlsx, which contains employee skill data required for task allocation. Ensure this file is properly formatted and placed in the project directory.

Thankyou! :)
